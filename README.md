#PROJECT: Predicting Company Profits

#ABSTRACT
In this project, I embarked on a compelling journey, one driven by the pursuit of understanding and harnessing the intricate dynamics of business profitability. In the digital age, where data reigns supreme, I set out to explore the nuances of financial success by delving deep into the world of machine learning and regression analysis. The primary objective of this solo endeavour was to construct robust predictive models that could unearth the factors influencing a company's profitability.
To achieve this, I have been provided with a dataset that encapsulated the financial profiles of numerous startups. These data points included R&D spending, marketing expenditures, and other crucial variables. With meticulous attention to detail, I conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis to comprehend the intricacies of these variables and how they interacted. This initial step laid the foundation for the subsequent phases of the project.
The project's core challenge was to create regression models capable of forecasting a company's profitability. I selected a diverse array of regression algorithms, from traditional linear and ridge regression to more advanced techniques like support vector regression and neural network regression. My decision to employ this spectrum of models was driven by a desire to uncover which approach would yield the most accurate and reliable predictions.
In addition to building the models, I implemented rigorous feature selection techniques to determine which factors played the most significant roles in influencing profitability. This process involved thorough correlation analysis and an examination of feature importance scores derived from ensemble methods. These insights were invaluable in refining the models and optimizing their predictive capabilities.
Throughout this project, I employed standardization and scaling techniques to ensure that all variables were on an even footing. Rigorous testing and evaluation were integral components of the process, and I relied on metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared, mean absolute error, and root mean squared error to assess model performance.
